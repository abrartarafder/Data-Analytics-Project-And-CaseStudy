Problem Statement: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Cycling company called Cyclistic is interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends. 

Questions will guide the future marketing program:
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Consider distance travelled which would be estimated using time rather than latitude
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
Tourism, more distance perhaps, attractions and sighseeing
How digital media could affect their marketing tactics.
